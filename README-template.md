## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser _(optional)_

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

- Set up HTML semantic tags with BEM
- Design for mobile first
- Make things functional with JS
- Make things pretty with CSS
- Finalize and polish everything by debugging everything.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS
- Sass

### What I learned

Managing different states of a webpage is quite difficult and I need to find a better and more efficient way to do so. Setting intersection observer was a little bit of a breakthrough for me since I no longer need to be checking for an element's display property with a loop. 


### Continued development

Animating shadows was quite tricky. It was also not advised to put animation on shadows and instead use something like opacity on a pseudo element which unfortunately did not work in my case. My shadows were'nt visible on the my element, the reason for which I could not figure out.

### Useful resources

- [Css Shadows](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/box-shadow/) - This helped me better understand and customize my shadows.
